## Comments

### HTML
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

### CSS/TailwindCSS
- Type Hierarchy styles are missing

### Responsive Design
- The font you have chosen for your site is only available in all caps. You should not use this font because of this. Body copy text should not be in all caps because it is more challenging to read and is an accessibility concern.
- The images in your project cards are different heights, causing the text to be misaligned
- The card grids become 3 columns at too small of a screen size. The content is too large and overflows.

### Assignment Requirements
- Accessibility features are missing:
  - No skip links
  - No To Top
  - No tabbing and focus features/styling
